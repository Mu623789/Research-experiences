# Research-experiences
This repository is a summary of my research projects.
## 1. Practice on Visual Autoregressive Super-Resolution (VARSR) for Cultural Heritage 
This is a reproducible restoration pipeline for real-world stone grotto mural/statue images, addressing low resolution, weathering degradation, noise/compression artifacts, and fine-detail loss. It supports memory-efficient tile-based inference for ultra-large images and offers two SR backbones: VARSR and SwinIR.

The VARSR route is reproduced and extended as a multi-scale autoregressive SR framework with LR-token prefix conditioning and scale-aligned RoPE for spatial consistency, plus a two-stage refinement (VAR for structure + lightweight diffusion for high-frequency textures). Trained with 4M HQ images and 50k LQ negatives, it achieves a 17% perceptual gain over SwinIR and is validated on Longmen Grottoes mural restoration.
## 2. Quantifying and Mitigating Conformity in LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems
A controlled evaluation benchmark was built to quantify social conformity by creating four-option multiple-choice tasks with bias-injected distractors and a staged protocol that isolates social signals. Results show clear susceptibility to peer influence, with accuracy dropping from **52%** (solo) to **48%** under mere peer presence, and under five pressure intensities (L1–L5) conformity increasing to **44%** while accuracy falls to **26%** under extreme deceptive signals. To improve robustness, **50k** low-quality negative samples were curated via specialized cleaning/annotation workflows, and a confidence-anchored filtering mechanism (**POF**) was introduced using independent inference stages to stabilize decision-making, recovering accuracy back to **52%** (solo-level).
## 3. Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM/ICM)
A Bayesian inverse inference framework was developed to tackle the strong non-identifiability inherent in many-to-one voting systems with latent audience distributions. The approach implements Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) using constrained simplex sampling and rule-consistent forward simulation to handle deterministic tie-breaking. Across **34 seasons (301 weeks)** of historical data, posterior predictive checks show robust replay consistency and around **63%** predictive accuracy in elimination rounds. Counterfactual simulations further quantify how alternative voting rules shift outcomes under uncertainty, revealing high-sensitivity boundary conditions that govern systemic stability.
